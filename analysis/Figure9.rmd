## Process of Figure 9 Replication

Being a very similar figure to figure 6, figure 9 was replicated by the same process. Variations on the 'ratio' calculation for 'friends to followers' were experimented with, including a direct ratio and a log of the ratio. However, the calculation that yielded the scale most like the original figure was the ratio of the logs of each value.
